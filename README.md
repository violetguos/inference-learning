# ECE521 Inference Learning Algorithm
[![Build Status](https://github.com/violetguos/inference-learning/blob/master/A3/vg-branch/a3-vg.ipynb)](https://github.com/violetguos/inference-learning/blob/master/A3/vg-branch/a3-vg.ipynb)

ECE521 was a grad/undergrad intro machine learning course, with an emphasis on tensorflow programming.

  - A1: knn in tensorflow
  - A2: logistic regression in tensorflow
  - A3: fully connected NN

### A3: fully connected NN

Implemented
* [Dropout](https://github.com/violetguos/inference-learning/blob/master/A3/vg-branch/a3-vg.ipynb) - prevent overfitting
* [Randomized architecture](https://github.com/violetguos/inference-learning/blob/master/A3/vg-branch/a3-vg.ipynb) -


### Installation

Install Tensorflow with Conda
