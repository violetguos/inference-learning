# ECE521 Inference Learning Algorithm


ECE521 was a grad/undergrad intro machine learning course, with an emphasis on tensorflow programming.

  - A1: knn in tensorflow
  - A2: logistic regression in tensorflow
  - A3: fully connected NN in tensorflow

### A3: fully connected NN
Implemented
* [Dropout](https://github.com/violetguos/inference-learning/blob/master/A3/vg-branch/a3-vg.ipynb) - prevent overfitting
* Xavier Initialization
* Relu activation function
* Early stopping
* vectorized matrix multiplications
* batch/epoch training

### Installation
Install Tensorflow with Conda
`jupyter notebook`
`python 3`
