[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

ECE521 was a grad/undergrad intro machine learning course, with an emphasis on tensorflow programming.

  - A1: knn in tensorflow
  - A2: logistic regression in tensorflow
  - A3: fully connected NN

### A3: fully connected NN

Implemented
* [Dropout]() - prevent overfitting
* [Randomized architecture]() -


### Installation

Install Tensorflow with Conda
